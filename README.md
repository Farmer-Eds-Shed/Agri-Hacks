## Agile Development

<a name="agile"></a>

This project was developed following the priciples of Agile Development, GitHub Projects and Milestones were used to track planning and progress. <br>

User stories were created as Issues and assigned to a Milestone(Epic), progress was tracked via the projects board. Each user story was given an acceptance criteria to clearly define when it was completed. <br>

As User Stories were worked on they were moved into the "In Progress" section of the Project board, when a user story matched its acceptance criteria it was closed and moved the  "Done" section. When new features were decided upon after the initial project planning they were also added to the "To Do" Section.
